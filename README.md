# Chat-Text-Segmenter

## TOPIC SEGMENTER

This tool segment group chat into several conversations and each conversation represents a
different subject. We have used the knowledge of Natural Language Processing and Neural
Networks.

## IMPORTANT POINTS TO CONSIDERED

1. Messages from a same group and related to a particular topic many not be sequential.
2. We have segmented a single large conversation related to the same topics into smaller
subtopics.
3. The reply texts such as ‘OK’, ‘nice ‘, ’I agree’ are treated as the category of the same
topic.
