U071X9XPC says -=*[1456428088.000129]-=*::: <http://Onename.com|Onename.com> is one application, it registers usernames and profiles in the .id namespace and so far more than 46,000 have been registered <https://resolver.onename.com/v2/namespaces>. OpenBazaar just did an integration to use Blockstack for mapping between GUID (long identifiers) to human-readable names for their stores and users. RushWallet used this technology to power usernames to Bitcoin address mapping. There are a bunch more. See this page for potential new namespaces/applications <https://blockstack.org/docs/namespaces> . Great idea about maintaining a list on the website.

U071X9XPC says -=*[1456859567.000174]-=*::: Some interesting parts of the article:
U071X9XPC says -=*[1456859573.000175]-=*::: ```To wit, the read protocol for Bitcoin is to discard the last  blocks of the blockchain. ```
U071X9XPC says -=*[1456859672.000176]-=*::: ``` issues of consistency probably stems from two sources: (1) academics' failure to provide a simple, accessible framework for reasoning about consistency, and (2) certain companies' deliberate, decade-long effort to muddy up the consistency landscape and falsely claiming that consistency is an impossible property to achieve under any circumstance. ```
U074Q9Q3D says -=*[1456859788.000177]-=*::: &gt; (1) academics' failure to provide a simple, accessible framework for reasoning about consistency Would love a good solution to this.  It's definitely not easy when you have to through out the notion of "this happens, and then that happens" when reasoning about your program's behavior
U071X9XPC says -=*[1456859961.000179]-=*::: Ha! Was literally inspired by that line and adding papers in <https://github.com/blockstack/reading-list/blob/master/README.md> for it
U07DTHT7G says -=*[1456894900.000181]-=*::: I need to prod Gun on a bit more what he meant.  Using the word strong consistency, what hes probably implying is linearizability, which means that you need to have a real-time guarantee.  So the time that node A thing their write succeeded, all other parties in the world would need to see that write.  One way to do this, which he vaguely aludes to, is to delay the confirmation of the write to the client until it is actually committed  it bitcoins context, that could be when its ~6 transactions deep.    But, wow, thats a high latency for writes.  And if you want to preserve the local ordering of a single clients operations in the global ordering (which all good consistency protocols do), you better only be making one outstanding write at any time.  Wow, thats low throughput.
U071X9XPC says -=*[1456919188.000183]-=*::: Yeah I think his point is to ignore the blocks that have less than X confirmations where X can be 6. Once you do that you have total ordering on writes for all readers in the system. 
U071X9XPC says -=*[1456919328.000184]-=*::: Interesting point about one outstanding write at a time for ordering of operations that you are sending. We face this when ensuring the ordering that a "preorder" of a particular name should come before a "register/reveal". 
U07DTHT7G says -=*[1456921842.000185]-=*::: <@U071X9XPC>: Then you have massive read latencyor you at least dont provide linearizability, which is typically what systems people mean when they say strong consistency.  I.e., if I do a write that succeeds, then you perform a read, but b/c X &lt; 6, the read doesnt return the value, they we fail this real-time property.
U07DTHT7G says -=*[1456922016.000186]-=*::: (Actually, its not clear offhand how you could do this by delaying the read protocol, as there is no real logical confirmation when a value should get 6-deep.  Let me try to explain.  You either pay a latency cost at write time or read time, where you need to wait for your operation to commit to a quorum of nodes.  Say a system has N nodes.  Writing to N, reading from 1 ensures that all reads will see the write (the intersection between the write and read quorums is non-empty).  Writing to 1, reading from N works, as does writing to any X &lt; N and reading from N-X+1.
U07DTHT7G says -=*[1456922227.000187]-=*::: So you can see how one can make writes or reads more expensive / take longer.  But control this b/c the party in the system knows when a read/write is finished and a response/ACK can be returned to the client/user  when some *number* of system nodes responsible for that key actually respond to a request.   Its not clear offhand (although havent thought of this long) how this maps to getting an ACK from each node, although maybe you could do something by specifying the height of the blockchain in your request.
U07DTHT7G says -=*[1456922331.000188]-=*::: Or, Gun could be referring to a weaker property called sequential consistency, and hes just using the term strong to read a lay audience.  Which has the same ordering requirements for exposed values (reads), but drops the real-time requirement.  I know he knows this stuff though, so...
U074Q9Q3D says -=*[1456932761.000192]-=*::: I don't think the blockchain fits into one of the "classic" consistency models, since the possibility (however remote) of chain reorganizations and the possibility of chain forks both mean that the write-history itself is not stable.  Transactions can change order relative to one another, and transactions can get dropped.  However, in practice and in the absence of forks, the probability that transactions A and B switch their relative orders decreases exponentially with the number of confirmations.  They don't switch their relative orders at all if, w.l.o.g., B consumes as an input one of A's unspent outputs, since then A *must* come before B for the blockchain to be valid.  All bets are off in the presence of an arbitrarily deep fork, though--transactions on the losing fork can simply disappear (while miners may *attempt* to migrate transactions from the losing fork to the winning fork, this is not required by the protocol IIRC).  However, it's extremely difficult to reliably create an arbitrarily deep fork (it would require over 50% mining power), and the probability of it happening randomly decreases exponentially with the number of confirmations.  Once a miner gains the ability to reliably create an arbitrarily deep fork, applications relying on the blockchain for consistency should fail fast and stop accepting new transactions until the mining power becomes more distributed (i.e. 51% attacks are survivable, as long as the transactions in attacker-generated blocks can be dealt with--i.e. thrown out if invalid).
U071X9XPC says -=*[1456933427.000193]-=*::: We just had a discussion about this in person. I basically said something along the line of:
U071X9XPC says -=*[1456933452.000194]-=*::: In my mind the network represents a slow-write system (and not a slow-read system).
U071X9XPC says -=*[1456933506.000195]-=*::: You can (and should) basically ignore the last x=6 (or larger) blocks and not return a write until you get &gt; x=6 confirmations.
U071X9XPC says -=*[1456933558.000196]-=*::: The blockstack CLI kind of does this, where the name youre registering is shown in the queue with no. of confirmations and doesnt show up in your wallet until after enough confirmations (thats when the write completes)
