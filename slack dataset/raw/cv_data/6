U1URG187Q says -=*[1469646559.000250]-=*::: Im trying to build minikube locally on Mac, but its failing. Im not familiar with GO, so this might be just a simple dependencies problem. I couldnt find a step by step description that works, so I thought somebody here could help. Heres the output: ``` make can't load package: package <http://k8s.io/minikube/cmd/localkube/cmd|k8s.io/minikube/cmd/localkube/cmd>: cannot find package "<http://k8s.io/minikube/cmd/localkube/cmd|k8s.io/minikube/cmd/localkube/cmd>" in any of:  /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.6.3/libexec/src/k8s.io/minikube/cmd/localkube/cmd (from $GOROOT)  ($GOPATH not set) can't load package: package <http://k8s.io/minikube/cmd/minikube/cmd|k8s.io/minikube/cmd/minikube/cmd>: cannot find package "<http://k8s.io/minikube/cmd/minikube/cmd|k8s.io/minikube/cmd/minikube/cmd>" in any of:  /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.6.3/libexec/src/k8s.io/minikube/cmd/minikube/cmd (from $GOROOT)  ($GOPATH not set) can't load package: package <http://k8s.io/minikube/pkg/minikube/machine|k8s.io/minikube/pkg/minikube/machine>: cannot find package "<http://k8s.io/minikube/pkg/minikube/machine|k8s.io/minikube/pkg/minikube/machine>" in any of:  /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.6.3/libexec/src/k8s.io/minikube/pkg/minikube/machine (from $GOROOT)  ($GOPATH not set) can't load package: package <http://k8s.io/minikube/cmd/minikube/cmd|k8s.io/minikube/cmd/minikube/cmd>: cannot find package "<http://k8s.io/minikube/cmd/minikube/cmd|k8s.io/minikube/cmd/minikube/cmd>" in any of:  /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.6.3/libexec/src/k8s.io/minikube/cmd/minikube/cmd (from $GOROOT)  ($GOPATH not set) can't load package: package <http://k8s.io/minikube/pkg/minikube/machine|k8s.io/minikube/pkg/minikube/machine>: cannot find package "<http://k8s.io/minikube/pkg/minikube/machine|k8s.io/minikube/pkg/minikube/machine>" in any of:  /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.6.3/libexec/src/k8s.io/minikube/pkg/minikube/machine (from $GOROOT)  ($GOPATH not set) can't load package: package <http://k8s.io/minikube/cmd/minikube/cmd|k8s.io/minikube/cmd/minikube/cmd>: cannot find package "<http://k8s.io/minikube/cmd/minikube/cmd|k8s.io/minikube/cmd/minikube/cmd>" in any of:  /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.6.3/libexec/src/k8s.io/minikube/cmd/minikube/cmd (from $GOROOT)  ($GOPATH not set) can't load package: package <http://k8s.io/minikube/pkg/minikube/machine|k8s.io/minikube/pkg/minikube/machine>: cannot find package "<http://k8s.io/minikube/pkg/minikube/machine|k8s.io/minikube/pkg/minikube/machine>" in any of:  /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.6.3/libexec/src/k8s.io/minikube/pkg/minikube/machine (from $GOROOT)  ($GOPATH not set) if [ ! -e /Users/mdlima/Projects/github/minikube/_gopath/src/k8s.io ]; then mkdir -p /Users/mdlima/Projects/github/minikube/_gopath/src/k8s.io &amp;&amp; ln -s -f /Users/mdlima/Projects/github/minikube /Users/mdlima/Projects/github/minikube/_gopath/src/k8s.io; fi docker run -w /go/src/k8s.io/minikube -e IN_DOCKER=1 -v /Users/mdlima/Projects/github/minikube:/go/src/k8s.io/minikube <http://gcr.io/google_containers/kube-cross:v1.6.2-1|gcr.io/google_containers/kube-cross:v1.6.2-1> make out/localkube Unable to find image '<http://gcr.io/google_containers/kube-cross:v1.6.2-1|gcr.io/google_containers/kube-cross:v1.6.2-1>' locally v1.6.2-1: Pulling from google_containers/kube-cross efd26ecc9548: Already exists a3ed95caeb02: Pull complete d1784d73276e: Pull complete 72e581645fc3: Pull complete 01ce90e06b06: Pull complete dd49ac13b118: Pull complete 3f4ffd08203e: Pull complete 5852efbc7938: Pull complete e48e8c8a4d44: Pull complete 2b2772320c24: Pull complete 7decd3565cf4: Pull complete 9561cef061a7: Pull complete db9ef80e4857: Pull complete 3a159ace5dec: Pull complete Digest: sha256:4cfee0cf31d80c81e774474a23663e60a6e9991159d8f3d41f57d464d5d80b69 Status: Downloaded newer image for <http://gcr.io/google_containers/kube-cross:v1.6.2-1|gcr.io/google_containers/kube-cross:v1.6.2-1> make: *** No rule to make target 'out/localkube'.

U0E5AMB36 says -=*[1469646860.000253]-=*::: $gopath not set
U1URG187Q says -=*[1469648634.000255]-=*::: thanks fo the reply <@U0E5AMB36>. Ive created a workspace folder and set gopath to it. `go get` the dependencies and it seemed to work. still, Im getting the same error: ``` $ make if [ ! -e /Users/mdlima/Projects/github/minikube/_gopath/src/k8s.io ]; then mkdir -p /Users/mdlima/Projects/github/minikube/_gopath/src/k8s.io &amp;&amp; ln -s -f /Users/mdlima/Projects/github/minikube /Users/mdlima/Projects/github/minikube/_gopath/src/k8s.io; fi docker run -w /go/src/k8s.io/minikube -e IN_DOCKER=1 -v /Users/mdlima/Projects/github/minikube:/go/src/k8s.io/minikube <http://gcr.io/google_containers/kube-cross:v1.6.2-1|gcr.io/google_containers/kube-cross:v1.6.2-1> make out/localkube make: *** No rule to make target 'out/localkube'.  Stop. make: *** [out/localkube] Error 2 ```
U0E5AMB36 says -=*[1469648680.000256]-=*::: i've quit go more often than i've used it because of dependency issues so unfortunately im not the man to help there
U1URG187Q says -=*[1469648899.000257]-=*::: me too, although Ive used it zero times in total now. :slightly_smiling_face: thanks for the help anyway.
U10AE1F99 says -=*[1469650042.000258]-=*::: hey, this isn't a gopath issue
U10AE1F99 says -=*[1469650057.000259]-=*::: well, it sort of is, but it looks more like a docker issue
U10AE1F99 says -=*[1469650067.000260]-=*::: you shouldn't ahve to "go get" anything
U10AE1F99 says -=*[1469650086.000261]-=*::: <@U1URG187Q>: how are you running Docker?
U10AE1F99 says -=*[1469650104.000262]-=*::: the line: docker run -w /go/src/k8s.io/minikube -e IN_DOCKER=1 -v /Users/mdlima/Projects/github/minikube:/go/src/k8s.io/minikube <http://gcr.io/google_containers/kube-cross:v1.6.2-1|gcr.io/google_containers/kube-cross:v1.6.2-1> make out/localkube is what does our build, and it's what's having trouble
U10AE1F99 says -=*[1469650124.000263]-=*::: we mount the source code into the image, then run "make out/localkube", that error usually means the source didn't get mounted correctly
U10AE1F99 says -=*[1469650145.000264]-=*::: with Docker for Mac and most docker-machine setups the /Users directory gets automatically mounted, but I think that didn't work for you for some reason
U0K61JBKJ says -=*[1469654147.000266]-=*::: guys, I found a few issues with minikube on windows that Im trying to fix, I got the code building on my mac and I can generate the necessary .exe but rather than litter the code with a lot of extraneous logs I was hoping to be able to debug the issue instead. Has anyone done remote debugging with VS Code?
U1URG187Q says -=*[1469656409.000268]-=*::: <@U10AE1F99>: yes, thats sort of what I was trying to check now. First time, I was running docker in minikube. Then I tried docker-machine. What I could gather is that the work path inside the running container was empty, but thats as far as I got
U10AE1F99 says -=*[1469656821.000269]-=*::: which docker machine driver are you using?
U1URG187Q says -=*[1469675111.000271]-=*::: <@U10AE1F99>: both times I tried with xhyve. tried now using virtualbox and it worked! thanks for the help.
U10AE1F99 says -=*[1469675154.000272]-=*::: ah yeah, that driver doesn't have folder sharing enabled by default
U10AE1F99 says -=*[1469675187.000273]-=*::: I think you have to pass a flag to enable it
U1URG187Q says -=*[1469675208.000274]-=*::: nice, Ill look it up.
U1URG187Q says -=*[1469675235.000275]-=*::: thanks again. :bow:
U0DSK18AG says -=*[1469730578.000277]-=*::: Quick Minikube 0.7.1 brew-cask formula: <https://gist.github.com/shanesveller/b30155054a040218cc88fc7d460a0ec1>
U1URG187Q says -=*[1469731365.000278]-=*::: thats nice <@U0DSK18AG>. have you tried creating a build formula too?
U0DSK18AG says -=*[1469732383.000279]-=*::: It's just an update of the existing Cask formula, so no, I didn't take it any further
U0DSK18AG says -=*[1469734441.000280]-=*::: do I have any options for making minikube not bind on the VM's public port 53, or alternately, to allow external-to-the-VM DNS queries in any fashion?
U0DSK18AG says -=*[1469734476.000281]-=*::: I had previously used dnsmasq to proxy to Consul DNS for both internal and external queries under vanilla docker-machine
U1JVDGD1S says -=*[1469739675.000283]-=*::: Where are minikube logs stored on my host machine?
U1JVDGD1S says -=*[1469739693.000284]-=*::: I don't see anything inside `/var/logs`
U1JVDGD1S says -=*[1469739722.000285]-=*::: I need access to the output of `kubectl logs &lt;pod&gt;` but I want to access the logfile from the container mount
U1HVAE448 says -=*[1469765882.000287]-=*::: I can't see or access /Users in minikube VM. Any ideas why?
U1VL8H66Q says -=*[1469814522.000288]-=*::: Working on trying to set up minikube as a dev environment. Rebuilding docker images for code changes is a lame way to do dev, so I would like to map a volume for code to the host. <https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#persistent-volumes> says you can map a volume to dir on VM. In theory I should be able to then map the dir on the VM to a dir on the host laptop. Does that seem like a sane/possible thing to do?
U0AKLD04R says -=*[1469819275.000290]-=*::: Does the add-ons folder get cleared each time minikube is booted?
U0AKLD04R says -=*[1469819293.000291]-=*::: Im wanting to add registry and everything was fine, then rebooted minikube and now gone.
U1WHC1ABE says -=*[1469821606.000293]-=*::: Hi - I'm having an issue in my local minikube cluster where my container services can't connect to other container services within the same pod. `nslookup` returns 10.x.x.x ips for the services but I can't connect using these IPs...  it works with the pod IP though (172.x.x.x)... help?
U10AE1F99 says -=*[1470081972.000298]-=*::: Hey <@U1HVAE448>, what driver are you using? /Users isonly accessible from virtualbox right now.
U10AE1F99 says -=*[1470082008.000299]-=*::: <@U1WHC1ABE>: could you open a bug with some more details? service DNS and networking should work
