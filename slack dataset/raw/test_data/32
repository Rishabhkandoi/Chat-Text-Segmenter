U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1483662619.000756]-=*::: <@U1X86991U> so how to read this is that  `Error: Unable to find field by name: Authorization` means that you have used the wrong field name.  You should take a look at <https://godoc.org/k8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/kube-apiserver/app/options#APIServer> to see how the fields are named
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1483662748.000758]-=*::: look like you need Authorization.Mode and Authorization.PolicyFile
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1483662777.000759]-=*::: it seems like authorization.rbacSuperUser has been deprecated <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubeapiserver/options/authorization.go#L75>
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1483662808.000761]-=*::: `Unable to set GenericServerRunOptions.RuntimeConfig to api/all=true,<http://rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1alpha1|rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1alpha1>. Error: Unable to set type config.ConfigurationMap.` this is an actual error that im about to submit a fix for
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1483663486.000762]-=*::: this is the PR <https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/pull/965>
U1XLRPD8B says -=*[1483664192.000764]-=*::: <@U1TUWPL1M> So you mean `--extra-config=apiserver.Authorization.PolicyFile=path/to/policy.json`  is mandatory if `--extra-config=apiserver.Authorization.Mode=RBAC` provided?
U1XLRPD8B says -=*[1483664258.000765]-=*::: cuz I provided `--extra-config=apiserver.Authorization.Mode=RBAC` previously.
U1XLRPD8B says -=*[1483664356.000766]-=*::: Also, how about `--extra-config=Authentication.PasswordFile.PasswordFileAuthenticationOptions.BasicAuthFile=/Users/mingchinhsieh/basic-auth.csv` ? it seems not taking it at all.
U1XLRPD8B says -=*[1483669186.000768]-=*::: It seems `--extra-config=apiserver.Authorization.PolicyFile=path/to/policy.json` is for ABAC mode, see: <http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/> So does it mean in order to get RBAC to work, ABAC is mandatory?
U2MGHJJN4 says -=*[1483726058.000773]-=*::: <@U1TUWPL1M> thought I'd let you know that it seems it wasn't a minikube issue at all with my stateful set dns... I creatd a real cluster on google and deployed and am seeing the same issue :disappointed:. will try again in minikube when I figure out what I'm doing wrong :slightly_smiling_face:. thanks for the help yesterday
U0PRC9KPY says -=*[1483727426.000774]-=*::: does anyone use storage-class with minikube?
U0PRC9KPY says -=*[1483727457.000775]-=*::: i have a helm chart that specifies a storage-class annotation, and I created a PV with a matching StorageClass annotation
U0PRC9KPY says -=*[1483727469.000776]-=*::: and it still creates the PV in /tmp/hostpath_pv
U0PRC9KPY says -=*[1483727502.000777]-=*::: if I take away the storage-class annotation on the PVC in the chart
U0PRC9KPY says -=*[1483727507.000778]-=*::: and create an un-annotated PV
U0PRC9KPY says -=*[1483727519.000779]-=*::: the mapping is successful (it doesnt create one of those tmp pvs)
U2MGHJJN4 says -=*[1483727855.000780]-=*::: <@U1TUWPL1M> *doh* it seems the issue was my service didn't have selectors.... which is odd since i assumed that the pods being in the dashboard under the service meant they were "in sync". I'm guessing also that a confusion was that the use of `serviceName` in the stateful set is how the hostname name gets set, making it look like the service and stateful set are working togethe properly
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1483727884.000781]-=*::: <@U2MGHJJN4> awesome, glad you got it working
U2MGHJJN4 says -=*[1483727884.000782]-=*::: once I added a selector to the server and labels in the spec of the stateful set it started working
U2MGHJJN4 says -=*[1483727899.000783]-=*::: I may have to suggest some improvements to the docs :slightly_smiling_face:
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1483727901.000784]-=*::: its tough, sometime the documentation for k8s isn't that great
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1483727909.000785]-=*::: yep, and things move quickly
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1483727913.000786]-=*::: hard to get devs to write docs :slightly_smiling_face:
U2MGHJJN4 says -=*[1483727914.000787]-=*::: right
U2MGHJJN4 says -=*[1483727919.000788]-=*::: hehe :slightly_smiling_face:
U2MGHJJN4 says -=*[1483727936.000789]-=*::: now to get back to using minikube hopefully
