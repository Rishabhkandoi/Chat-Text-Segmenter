U074Q9Q3D says -=*[1476020871.000701]-=*::: Blockstack mentioned here.  <https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/09/a-decentralized-web-would-give-power-back-to-the-people-online/>
U08BDV693 says -=*[1476033003.000706]-=*::: <@U25JPMENL>: thank you! We're doing our part to deflate the hype bubble around "blockchain". 
U08BDV693 says -=*[1476033865.000707]-=*::: The top down approach can lead to wishful thinking. I saw a lot of that back in the dotcom bubble. In my view, you have to be cognizant of the technology's limitations. Otherwise you end up proselytizing Uber to people with dial-up modems and 640x480 screen resolutions. 
U25JPMENL says -=*[1476039115.000709]-=*::: <@U08BDV693>: that is a good observation as none of the healthcare blockchain companies I am aware of have any significant domain expertise outside of medical devices which marginally matters at the end of the day when it comes to improving actual patient outcomes but my assumption is any team worth their salt will have both domain and tech expertise which is what is currently missing in this space.  I have over 250 healthcare providers in our network who have been great at educating our devs and myself about the realities and opportunities in the space and interoperability at best helps at the margin....good luck fighting over .15 of every reimbursement set aside for technology....we are playing in the .85 bucket....much greater odds of success 
U08BDV693 says -=*[1476039260.000710]-=*::: <@U25JPMENL>: Tierion isn't a healthcare company. We just happen to have some customers in that industry. 
U25JPMENL says -=*[1476039564.000711]-=*::: <@U08BDV693>: understood my  comment was directed more at healthtech wannabe companies not yours necessarily 
U25JPMENL says -=*[1476039936.000712]-=*::: <@U08BDV693>: what I find interesting is the healthy balance of skepticism and fear on the buy-side on Wall Street I learned speaking to a couple of large asset managers recently....that's a good sign...
