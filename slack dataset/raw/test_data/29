U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483467780.000729]-=*::: yes
U0JFJ4KHS says -=*[1483467881.000730]-=*::: yes, it is recommended to use internal NIC for kubeproxy, but we still require two external NICs with the current approach and still working with Microsoft to resolve external network access issue
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483467977.000731]-=*::: we're working with Jason and the rest of the MSFT team, things look pretty good for the OVS approach

U0JFJ4KHS says -=*[1483468034.000733]-=*::: thats great :+1:
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483468084.000734]-=*::: <@U1B51TCUW> i was the one looking at Network Controller.
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483468096.000735]-=*::: unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work on cloud providers.
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483468142.000736]-=*::: <@U0ALRFJH0> do you know what's the issue with the NC for cloud providers? :slightly_smiling_face:
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483468166.000737]-=*::: well, i need to correct myself: it doesn't seem to work on cloud providers that provide you VMs without virtualization support.
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483468185.000738]-=*::: got it, you need nested virtualization
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483468227.000739]-=*::: good news for OVS, is that even if it's a VMswitch forwarding extension (the same used by Hyper-V), it dos not need VT-x features
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483468236.000740]-=*::: OVS leverages Windows SDN, does it not?
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483468261.000741]-=*::: yes, it's a VMswitch forwarding extension
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483468304.000742]-=*::: <@U1B51TCUW> if it doesn't need virtualization features, will it work on nodes with a single physical NIC?
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483468324.000743]-=*::: yes
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483468362.000744]-=*::: i'm pretty new to Windows SDN but it seems that it enables overlay networking, and that's what i was trying to achieve for easier networking.
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483468388.000745]-=*::: one docker network plug-in that would automate the overlay network setup is my end goal.
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483468406.000746]-=*::: just to be clear, OVS is not not using the Windows SDN overlays
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483468410.000747]-=*::: 
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483468417.000748]-=*::: this would be great!
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483468452.000749]-=*::: <@U1B51TCUW> thanks for clarifying. do you implement your own stuff or is there something blocking WSDN overlay network adoption?
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483468495.000750]-=*::: anyway, S-NAT is what's needed in order to resolve external network access issue <@U0JFJ4KHS>.
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483468500.000751]-=*::: OVS consists in a kernel driver and userspace tools (ovs-vsctl.exe, etc)
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483468515.000752]-=*::: the kernel driver is a vmswitch forwarding extension, which loads in place of the one coming with Windows Server 2016
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483468542.000753]-=*::: the userspace tools and services are the same that you find on linux, just ported and compiled for Windows
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483468562.000754]-=*::: <@U0ALRFJH0> are you familiar with OVS on Linux by any chance?
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483468639.000755]-=*::: OVS uses OVSDB and OpenFlow to configure overlays (VXLAN, GRE, GENEVE, MPLS, etc) and other flow rules
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483468672.000756]-=*::: <@U1B51TCUW> i'd have to refresh my memory but i've used it before for GRE tunnels.
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483468689.000757]-=*::: it supports one or more nics, including LACP bonding
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483468732.000758]-=*::: the great side, is that once the containers are attached to the switch, all the networking configuration is done with the same OVSDB commands that are used on Linux
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483468764.000759]-=*::: this means that the same code used by k8s on Linux OVS networking works on Windows out of the box
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483468780.000760]-=*::: i need to refresh my OVS know-how then because GRE tunnelling is something I was looking at in Windows SDN.
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483468785.000761]-=*::: additionally, you can have Linux and Windows pods sharing the same networking overlays
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483468793.000762]-=*::: ^ exactly!!!!!
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483468812.000763]-=*::: :slightly_smiling_face:

U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483468957.000771]-=*::: even vxlan mode would work for what i'm looking for.
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483468963.000772]-=*::: Blog post series: <https://cloudbase.it/open-vswitch-2-5-hyper-v-part-1/>
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483468994.000774]-=*::: yes, tons of overlay options: VXLAN, GRE, GENEVE, MPLS, etc
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483469014.000775]-=*::: and most important: fully interoperable with Linux :slightly_smiling_face:
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483469057.000776]-=*::: is there a roadmap for Windows support, i.e. any ETA for NAT?
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483469093.000777]-=*::: Windows support is already there for all L2 stuff, overlays etc
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483469101.000778]-=*::: for both VMs and containers
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483469119.000779]-=*::: firewalling (conntrack) is also there
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483469136.000780]-=*::: whats missing is only the NAT for L3, which is planned for 2.7
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483469152.000781]-=*::: so in the next couple of months, to give a rough roadmap
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483469160.000782]-=*::: great!
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483469193.000783]-=*::: when you say there's support for L2 stuff in containers, do you mean you were able to use OVS in Windows Containers?
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483469200.000784]-=*::: yes
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483469208.000785]-=*::: i'm wondering what type of network is used and how it was created.
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483469224.000786]-=*::: <@U3L4RE1UG>, do you think we can do a quick demo?
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483469226.000787]-=*::: `docker network create -d &lt;type&gt;..`
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483469257.000788]-=*::: i'm based in Portugal so it should be easy for us to set-up a demo. eager to take a look!
U3L4RE1UG says -=*[1483469315.000789]-=*::: this is part of our talk at OVS conference from 2016
U3L4RE1UG says -=*[1483469317.000790]-=*::: <https://youtu.be/12BSDqqIxkI?t=1084>
U3L4RE1UG says -=*[1483469363.000792]-=*::: it uses the default network created while installing/setting up docker
U3L4RE1UG says -=*[1483469403.000793]-=*::: its purpose is more to just show that integration is there, but can be extended for every type of network
U3L4RE1UG says -=*[1483469494.000794]-=*::: ofc we can setup a demo :slightly_smiling_face:
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483469546.000795]-=*::: <@U0ALRFJH0> the final goal is to get this working on Windows too: <https://github.com/openvswitch/ovn-kubernetes>
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483469603.000797]-=*::: OVN is a controller that sits on top of OVS
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483469712.000798]-=*::: so right now, and forgetting about NAT, i can have two nodes, A is Linux and B is Windows and just by running OVS in overlay mode, i can have them communicating seamlessly?
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483470009.000800]-=*::: <@U1B51TCUW> ^
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483470080.000801]-=*::: sorry, got absorbed in a meeting :slightly_smiling_face:
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483470103.000802]-=*::: <@U0ALRFJH0> the answer is definitely yes!
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483470229.000803]-=*::: <@U1B51TCUW> we're looking into revamping kubelet support for Windows Containers by adopting CRI. i believe implementing a CRI network plug-in for OVS would make sense.
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483470244.000804]-=*::: you can have two (or more containers) on Linux or Windows and get them to communicate over VXLAN (or GRE, or...)
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483470287.000805]-=*::: <@U1B51TCUW> exactly. again, that's why i was looking at Windows SDN. but it was getting a little too complicated, really fast.
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483470495.000806]-=*::: ah, it seems someone worked on a CNI plug-in for OVN.
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483470655.000807]-=*::: AH, you're actually using that!
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483470794.000808]-=*::: but not for Windows, as i suspected.
U3L4RE1UG says -=*[1483470916.000810]-=*::: <@U0ALRFJH0> that will be the final goal :slightly_smiling_face:
U3L4RE1UG says -=*[1483470996.000811]-=*::: we could set up a demo in the mean time if you want
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483471554.000812]-=*::: <@U3L4RE1UG> i am definitely interested in that. when does it work for you?
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483471585.000813]-=*::: also, i'm interested in picking up that plug-in and making it Windows capable.
U0PPMUTGR says -=*[1483477540.000814]-=*::: <@U0JFJ4KHS> , the msft networking team is available today 2:30  5:00pm PST  if you want to meet and continue the intvestigation to get unblocked. would this work for you?
U0JFJ4KHS says -=*[1483477704.000816]-=*::: <@U0PPMUTGR> I will schedule something for tomorrow
U0PPMUTGR says -=*[1483477749.000817]-=*::: ok got it. thanks!
U3J5PDG85 says -=*[1483486065.000819]-=*::: <@U3F0QN1MW> - I am checking internally about RRAS support on Nano, but initial cursory checks point to it not being supported. <@U0JFJ4KHS> -  Curious to know RRAS usage that makes it a dependency.
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483523505.000820]-=*::: <@U3J5PDG85>, <@U0JFJ4KHS> is not able to have routing working without RRAS enabled.
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483523539.000821]-=*::: my setup on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) doesn't require RRAS but cloud routes need to be in place for mult-VM routing.
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483539769.000822]-=*::: <@U3J5PDG85> RRAS sould not be a dependency
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483539793.000823]-=*::: it should be just another CNI plugin, in case
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483539862.000824]-=*::: <@U0JFJ4KHS> do you have a CNI plugin that uses RRAS?
U0JFJ4KHS says -=*[1483540753.000825]-=*::: We are not using CNI plugins
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483540759.000826]-=*::: <@U1B51TCUW> we're not using CNI but manual subnet/route setup
U0JFJ4KHS says -=*[1483540767.000827]-=*::: are there any for Windows, I am not aware of any
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483540799.000828]-=*::: i was investigating how we could automate networking setup but requirements seem to change from on-prem to each cloud-provider, e.g. GCP is different than Azure.
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483540835.000829]-=*::: <@U0JFJ4KHS> i don't think so. CNI is very specific to Linux containers. but CNI is also very limited and external daemon is mostly needed, e.g. Weave or Calico
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1483540853.000830]-=*::: i believe the same applies to OVS CNI plug-in
U1B51TCUW says -=*[1483541059.000831]-=*::: <@U0ALRFJH0> <@U0JFJ4KHS> cool thanks, were now doing a new deployment with OVS / OVN, Ill post our findings ASAP

U3LMBA1BP says -=*[1483550277.000833]-=*::: <@U0JFJ4KHS>  Thanks for the link. Can i try Kubernetes for Windows  Server 2016 in Virtualbox. If yes then could you please help me how can i do that.
U3J5PDG85 says -=*[1483552860.000834]-=*::: <@U0ALRFJH0> <@U0JFJ4KHS> Thanks for the clarifications. Presume the "route add .. " commands from the Getting Started guide are not working correctly on-prem without RRAS?
U0JFJ4KHS says -=*[1483552989.000835]-=*::: thats right `route add` didn't had any effect unless RRAS was enabled
U3J5PDG85 says -=*[1483553022.000836]-=*::: <@U0PPMUTGR> can you please send the MS SDN contact name again? You replied when I was on vacation, and apparently I can't view history that far back on this channel.
U3J5PDG85 says -=*[1483553078.000837]-=*::: <@U0JFJ4KHS> ok I'll try to investigate why this is the case.

U0PPMUTGR says -=*[1483630103.000842]-=*::: i would be very interested in that Pires. Jitu also had a meeting with the msft folks  and the results were not as promising

U3J6R92NB says -=*[1482441976.000360]-=*::: there is some recommendation <https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/DRIVERS.md#hyperv-driver>
U3J6R92NB says -=*[1482441992.000362]-=*::: need to do this?
U3J6R92NB says -=*[1482442036.000363]-=*::: `Start-VM : Hyper-V no pudo encontrar una maquina virtual con el nombre "minikube".`
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1482442068.000364]-=*::: yeah you might need to try that recommendation
U3J6R92NB says -=*[1482442558.000366]-=*::: seems needed <https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/pull/860/files>
U3J6R92NB says -=*[1482442593.000368]-=*::: a no, just "may need"
U3J6R92NB says -=*[1482442961.000369]-=*::: Yes it seem to worki with this

U3J6R92NB says -=*[1482445956.000371]-=*::: Should I do something to make persistent volumes work?
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1482446138.000372]-=*::: PVs of type hostpath should work

U3J6R92NB says -=*[1482446200.000375]-=*::: I just don't get what action should take
U3J6R92NB says -=*[1482446234.000376]-=*::: should I `kubectl apply` this config?

U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1482446298.000378]-=*::: probably the easiest way is to save that to a file and kubectl create -f
U3J6R92NB says -=*[1482446362.000379]-=*::: and on windows how should path look like?
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1482446392.000380]-=*::: path could be anything
U3J6R92NB says -=*[1482446405.000381]-=*::: is this a windows host path?
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1482446412.000382]-=*::: no
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1482446415.000383]-=*::: this is a path inside the VM

U3J6R92NB says -=*[1482446800.000385]-=*::: how does minikube gives external IPs to services?
U3J6R92NB says -=*[1482447575.000386]-=*::: Is it possible that minikube give to LoadBalancer service type IP?
U15PMDQ2E says -=*[1482522088.000391]-=*::: No <@U3J6R92NB>, minikube can only create NodePort for Services
U15PMDQ2E says -=*[1482522106.000392]-=*::: LoadBalancer is only for Google or AWS clouds
U0PRC9KPY says -=*[1482600366.000395]-=*::: <@U3J6R92NB> what Ive been doing is basically ``` kubectl expose service $DEPLOYMENT --name=jenkins --port=80   --target-port=8080 external-ip=10.0.2.15 ``` where 80 is the port that you see the Deployment trying to expose via a pending service, and 10.0.2.15:8080 is the port that VirtualBox exposes on its NAT interface (I have a strange circumstance so I cant use the host-only interface)
U0PRC9KPY says -=*[1482600395.000396]-=*::: so, for hyperV its sure to be somewhat different, with regard to addresses at least
U0PRC9KPY says -=*[1482600472.000397]-=*::: VirtualBox seems to run as unprivileged user so its not possible to expose a privileged port on its port forwarding config to the localhost
U0PRC9KPY says -=*[1482600500.000398]-=*::: but Ill use macs pf to provide a forward from 80 to 8080 in that case so the app is more naturally exposed as <http://localhost> or some more realistic public interface
U0PRC9KPY says -=*[1482600526.000399]-=*::: this is a great contortion you can use so that you dont have to invest in proper load balancers or cloud services that provide them
U0PRC9KPY says -=*[1482600547.000400]-=*::: it may also be a good idea to do that instead (real load balancers)
