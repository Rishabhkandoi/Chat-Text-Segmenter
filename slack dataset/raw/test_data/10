U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465848741.000023]-=*::: Homeland Security needs databases. Blockchain offers them nothing unless there's counterparty risk

U07HTRSQN says -=*[1465848829.000030]-=*::: Maybe they think they can operate a consortium-style cluster distributed among the law enforcement and military branches to help secure their systems better? (Assuming all payloads are encrypted with identity keys)

U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465848839.000032]-=*::: It makes sense if they don't trust themselves. Which Is a weird problem for an agency to have
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465848854.000033]-=*::: well, it makes sense when you think of it in terms of operatives and whistle blowers
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465848868.000034]-=*::: compartmentalization of information and control is very vaulable
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465848880.000036]-=*::: <@U07HTRSQN>: I think backups are probably a better solution there
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465848920.000037]-=*::: theyve talked about the desire to be able to enable operatives to communicate from behind enemy lines in a way that is completely anonymous to even themselves
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465848921.000038]-=*::: Blockchains don't offer permission control to the same degree and auditability that CRUD apps and databases do
U07HTRSQN says -=*[1465848928.000039]-=*::: I am not saying it's a great use, just throwing out a possibility
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465848953.000040]-=*::: I see - so they're going to place a copy of their blockchain outside the agency, in custody of someone inside the enemy lines?
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465848963.000041]-=*::: that makes sense
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849007.000042]-=*::: why wouldn't they just put a public website up, so they can audit accesses and times and such centrally?
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849129.000043]-=*::: sites can be blocked
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849191.000044]-=*::: gotcha
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849194.000045]-=*::: but blockchains can't
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849200.000046]-=*::: is it because they use port 8333?
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849205.000047]-=*::: you can change ports
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849207.000048]-=*::: right
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849211.000049]-=*::: even if you block 8333
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849218.000051]-=*::: and websites can't change ports
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849227.000052]-=*::: yeah, port 80, plus DNS, plus CA's
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849231.000053]-=*::: lots of control points
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849233.000054]-=*::: I see
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849250.000055]-=*::: so the reason for them to use a  blockchain is that they can change ports
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849252.000056]-=*::: that makes sense
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849265.000057]-=*::: How do vpns solve that problem then?
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849270.000058]-=*::: or tor
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849279.000059]-=*::: they're not blockchains...
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849284.000060]-=*::: Id imagine youd use all these tools together
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849293.000061]-=*::: well, why use a blockchain though?
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849297.000062]-=*::: users can be de-anonymized in tor though
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849303.000063]-=*::: if you can just use vpns and tor
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849304.000064]-=*::: blockchains are great for public key distribution
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849310.000065]-=*::: I see. So blockchains anonymize users
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849318.000066]-=*::: whereas tor does not
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849325.000067]-=*::: well kinda
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849341.000068]-=*::: sounds like tor should be rebuilt on blockchain
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849353.000069]-=*::: when you put your public key in the blockchain, everyone who has a copy of the blockchain gets a copy of your key
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849366.000070]-=*::: Id think of it like the blockchain solves the key distribution problem
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849383.000071]-=*::: then you can use any channel to communicate and youll at least have secure messaging
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849393.000072]-=*::: Gotcha
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849393.000073]-=*::: you can use tor to obfuscate the location of users fairly well
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849397.000074]-=*::: and vpns
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849407.000075]-=*::: and you can't distribute keys or communicate securely over httpp
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849425.000076]-=*::: no you cant
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849431.000077]-=*::: you have no guarantee of the integrity of the data
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849431.000078]-=*::: so,  is slack based on blockchain?
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849435.000079]-=*::: no its not
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849451.000080]-=*::: If I paste a bitcoin address here right now, you have no guarantee were both seeing the same address
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849464.000081]-=*::: gotcha
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849472.000082]-=*::: and if slack was a blockchain, then you'd have that guarantee
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849478.000083]-=*::: is that a bug in mysql?
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849493.000084]-=*::: if slack used a blockchain for data integrity *
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849502.000085]-=*::: er.. if slack used a blockchain-based identity system
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849504.000086]-=*::: yeah
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849514.000087]-=*::: and users exchanged public keys
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849526.000088]-=*::: then they could trust who theyre talking to and that the data hasnt been tampered with by a server
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849538.000089]-=*::: but, I thought blockchain solved that problem
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849542.000090]-=*::: yeah
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849550.000091]-=*::: blockchain-based identity systems solve this problem
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849554.000092]-=*::: blockstack!
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849560.000093]-=*::: that means that the homeland security would need to distribute keys prior to sending their servers behind enemy lines?
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849574.000094]-=*::: maybe, but no necessarily
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849587.000096]-=*::: I find blockchain very confusing
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849587.000097]-=*::: you can do knowledge-based challenges
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849595.000098]-=*::: it seems like any other message passing system to me
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849600.000099]-=*::: excetp with proof of work
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849620.000100]-=*::: its a message passing system where everyone gets all of the messages and can be certain that everyone has the same set
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849624.000101]-=*::: thats all it is :slightly_smiling_face:
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849628.000102]-=*::: first of its kind in that sense
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849632.000103]-=*::: proof of work accomplishes this
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849652.000104]-=*::: you could say other systems with federated consensus have this property too
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849662.000105]-=*::: but then you have to say certain with a caveat
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849675.000106]-=*::: well, pgp and smtp does that
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849686.000107]-=*::: so you need the work
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849687.000108]-=*::: no neither do
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849690.000109]-=*::: sure it does
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849692.000110]-=*::: I use it all the time
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849712.000111]-=*::: "everyone gets all of the messages all of the time"
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849713.000112]-=*::: all my emails are pgp encrypted, and sessions between servers are encrypted. And i get a signed ACK from each server
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849716.000113]-=*::: gotcha
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849727.000114]-=*::: So the difference is that with blockchain - there's no To: field
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849731.000115]-=*::: thats why you dont use the blockchain for sending large bits of data
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849732.000116]-=*::: yup
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849733.000117]-=*::: it just goes to everyone
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849736.000118]-=*::: makes sense
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849742.000119]-=*::: but why do they have to store anything?
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849753.000120]-=*::: why don't they just delete the things that dont concern them?
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849764.000121]-=*::: you can delete historical data that is no longer of use to you
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849776.000122]-=*::: but you still have to process every incoming block, which includes all info
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849788.000123]-=*::: so, how is this different than email?
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849790.000124]-=*::: the premise of the blockchain is that everyone maintaining the network validates 100% of the data
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849792.000125]-=*::: everyone gets to see your message?
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849798.000126]-=*::: kinda
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849808.000127]-=*::: why does homeland security want that?
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465849810.000128]-=*::: this is a much longer discussion
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849849.000129]-=*::: yeah. It's very complicated, I'm sure that people smarter than me must understand
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849857.000130]-=*::: It seems like it's just emails sent to everyone
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849868.000131]-=*::: which, seems like we've been able to do since the 80s
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465849987.000132]-=*::: I guess that homeland security would want the people on the enemy lines to see some messages
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465850001.000133]-=*::: so that maybe if there's a double agent, they could figure it out sooner
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465850010.000134]-=*::: with the help of the enemy
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465850622.000135]-=*::: <@U1G7P4W07>: Its much more complex than that
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465850634.000136]-=*::: Id read up on how bitcoin and proof of work operate
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465850647.000137]-=*::: I've read a bit about that. And Proof of work makes sense
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465850656.000138]-=*::: because there's counterparty risk
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465850662.000139]-=*::: and energy secures the chain from tampering
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465850679.000140]-=*::: Who do you think will mine the homeland security chain?
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465850694.000141]-=*::: maybe they can get energy from behind enemy lines, and divert it to homeland security
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465850702.000142]-=*::: that would makes sense, because it would cost the enemy money
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465850777.000143]-=*::: they could just use bitcoin
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465850789.000144]-=*::: Id imagine theyd want to
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465850805.000145]-=*::: just like they like using tor to hide in the crowd
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465850907.000146]-=*::: gotcha
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465850924.000147]-=*::: so, I don't think that's what they asked for
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465850929.000148]-=*::: I think they asked for a private blockchain
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465850938.000149]-=*::: to secure themselves from themselves
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465851012.000150]-=*::: yeah Im not sure
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465851018.000151]-=*::: it might have been another agency I was reading about
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465851029.000152]-=*::: I'm pretty sure private blockchains are always scams
U1G7P4W07 says -=*[1465851082.000153]-=*::: It's like people are selling  an "<mailto:everyone@allyourcompetitors.com|everyone@allyourcompetitors.com>" email address, as a database

U0722SJ4A says -=*[1465857119.000159]-=*::: Interesting that zeronet is in the decentralized webs category and blockstack is in the blockchain infrastructure category. I guess that makes sense but certain things could be in more than one group.
U071X9XPC says -=*[1465857881.000160]-=*::: yeah can ping him to ask the reason
U071X9XPC says -=*[1465857922.000161]-=*::: also not sure about the difference between decentralized development platform and blockchain infrastructure
U1DPY7CSE says -=*[1465866165.000167]-=*::: <@U0722SJ4A> and <@U071X9XPC> there's some stuff that zeronet is doing that makes sense for it to stand on its own IMO - like the integration with TOR. it also feels a lot like bittorrent
U1DPY7CSE says -=*[1465866167.000168]-=*::: just a thought
U07HTRSQN says -=*[1465919204.000175]-=*::: at some point I would love to see about bringing all these separate efforts together, if possible
U07HTRSQN says -=*[1465919238.000176]-=*::: too early now, but we're all going to need to agree on a few things to make this a widely accepted "Web 3.0"
U07HTRSQN says -=*[1465919277.000177]-=*::: I always gravitated to blockstack because it appeared to nail the foundation better than any other system
U07HTRSQN says -=*[1465919300.000178]-=*::: namely: register names, update them, index them, cache the indexes, and keep the system running
U07HTRSQN says -=*[1465919313.000179]-=*::: if a solution doesn't do those things, it is going to fail
