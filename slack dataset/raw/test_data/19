U076LGFE0 says -=*[1470739403.000628]-=*::: &gt;AbstractWe present an identity authentication system which is cryptographically strong, pseudonymous, efficient enough to run well on current smart phone devices, and easily extensible for payment and transactional functionality. We also describe high security algorithm and programming methods for the implemen- tation, including server, network transmission, and application development. The system is intellectual property unencumbered and provably secure. The end user app implementation uses multi factor security, a combination of unique device, user password, and fingerprint or PIN. We use well-known and proven cryptographic primitives.

U074Q9Q3D says -=*[1471051419.000686]-=*::: I enjoyed the reality check that article brought.  I think the lessons are that if you're going to do a coin sale, you should make sure that: (1) the coin-operated system is already up and running before the first sale,  (2) make sure there's no pre-mine, pre-issuance, or ICO (or if there is, it's only to accredited investors),  (3) make sure you don't control all the mining power from the get-go, and  (4) rigorously and publicly analyze the system to make sure it doesn't create perverse incentives for participants.

U0723KV7E says -=*[1471270676.000689]-=*::: &gt;Preston J. Byrne prestonbyrne "Against Crowdsales I agree with Preston on the majority of what he is saying but he clearly states I see nothing Normally, I would not chime in on a topic and let others battle it out but I actually feel bad for Preston on this post. Smart guy but does not actually see what the value of this NEW token concept is. Its not the currency of the past and the token is of value because the protocol layer has value. people are actually buying into the the value of the technology. While speculative at the beginning it may be, as the network grows, value increases as more and more users and apps are onboarded. There is no mention of this in his post. Great post if we were talking about the currencies of old however.
