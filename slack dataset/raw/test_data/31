U3G3J59DW says -=*[1483562800.000545]-=*::: <@U1TUWPL1M> i recreated (delete then start) the xhyve minikube box using that built binary and tested the 9P fs and it still failed in my setup. the same file setup works under vbox but the file performance is abysmal.   Whats odd is that im running the php-fpm processes as a user i made that = 1000 uid so that it owns the directory. It can create (f_write()) and edit files but returns nothing when attempting to scan a directory with built in php support across php7,6, and 5: `new RecursiveIteratorIterator(new RecursiveDirectoryIterator($dir), RecursiveIteratorIterator::SELF_FIRST );`  i wonder whats different about the files/mount options i cant tell if its a php bug or something different in how the files are accessed/made available and i dont know how to test that. is there a way i can alter the mount options for that 9p filesystem? im just generally out of ideas for ways to trouble shoot and thought you might have one. thanks again.
U3G3J59DW says -=*[1483562884.000546]-=*::: yikes sorry that didnt seem like such a manifesto when i typed it..
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1483563333.000547]-=*::: so the xhyve driver uses 9p for the /Users mount, you can actually modify the mount  options through the binary, although unfortunately minikube doesnt expose that
