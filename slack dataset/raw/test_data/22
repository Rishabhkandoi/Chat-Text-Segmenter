U07DTHT7G says -=*[1477230527.000885]-=*::: <@U0X9PT7DG> (and others):  That article points at DNS poisoning with Dyn (although strangely talks about DNS records on Dyns servers as being poisoned, while poisoning typically refers to cache poisoning which is a very different attack based on the (historically) limited set of IDs used to identify DNS responses, although this was mitigated in the last decade).  Thats the first Ive heard of DNS poisoning" in the context of the Dyn attacks  I had previously thought they were primarily DDoS attacks.   Do you know anything more about it?  If the primary focus is DDOS, its less clear how mechanisms focusing primarily on *security* (a la DNSSEC, or blockchain-based approaches) would help with *unavailability*, with the caveat that these systems do full replication (at the cost of scalability and/or personalization).  So, replicating your DNS zone file in the blockchain itself would certainly make it more survivable, but at the cost of being able to actively control server selection, e.g., performing load/locality-based selection very common among CDNs and large geo-replicated providers.
U07DTHT7G says -=*[1477230844.000886]-=*::: For what its worth, most solutions to DNS (including some of Guns prior work  ( <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/egs/papers/codons-sigcomm.pdf> <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/egs/papers/dnssurvey.pdf> ) focus on making old-school DNS more robust, i.e., the serving of static zone files.    That works if you are using a public third-party DNS service (although Dyn does appear to use Anycasted servers (<http://dyn.com/dns/network-map/>), so it perhaps localized the impact of these attacks), but not if you want programmatic, low-TTL control of resolution.  This seems a bit fundamental, although maybe some hybrid is also some solution, i.e., a fall back to static (round-robin) DNS resolution when your active servers arent available for any reason.
U074Q9Q3D says -=*[1477257132.000888]-=*::: &gt; with the caveat that these systems do full replication (at the cost of scalability and/or personalization) Full replication of static state (i.e. long-TTL state) could be done today.  If there were 10 billion public DNS names, and each DNS name was allotted 10KB of state, then a 10TB disk can hold the entire DNS state.  I can get 10TB of storage for less than $500.  It's not far-fetched to believe that we could give each home router a 100% replica of the DNS state (or if not home routers, then name servers at ISP peering points).  Either way, DNS lookups for static state could stay within your AS.  &gt;  but at the cost of being able to actively control server selection, e.g., performing load/locality-based selection very common among CDNs and large geo-replicated providers. I think this could be solved with one layer of indirection: have the service's static zonefile point to a set of "request-routing" servers that serve this dynamic information.  These request-routing servers would work as before, but the key improvement over the status quo is that if they get taken offline (like Dyn), the *service* can update its zonefile to point to a different set of request-routers (e.g. a back-up DNS cluster running in-house).  This limits the amount of time for which the attack on Dyn would be effective--all the affective sites would simply switch DNS providers, and all ISPs/home-routers would learn about the switch-over in a reasonable amount of time (e.g. however long it took for the underlying blockchain to confirm the update).

U071X9XPC says -=*[1477320457.000893]-=*::: <@U07DTHT7G> Yep, I also assumed that the concern is just DDoS and not DNS (cache) poisoning. RE availability, one interesting thing about a blockchain approach is that if I get you a copy of the blockchain you can independently verify that you have the correct version (proof of work). Cant do that with a version of DNS records shipped to you on a hard disk.
U071X9XPC says -=*[1477320516.000894]-=*::: Which means that we have more flexibility about how to widely replicate blockchain-based DNS records. The source of the records doesnt matter at all.
