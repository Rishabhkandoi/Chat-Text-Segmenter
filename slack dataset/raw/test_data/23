U36KK4Z09 says -=*[1480486491.001233]-=*::: Quantum computers don't exist. Quantum Mechanics is fantasy.
U36KK4Z09 says -=*[1480486520.001234]-=*::: An exponential problem can't be solved in polynomial time
U36KK4Z09 says -=*[1480486526.001235]-=*::: It is logically impossible
U36KK4Z09 says -=*[1480486579.001236]-=*::: And QM is a fantasy, because an entity can't be in two places at once. Its absurd.
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1480487717.001237]-=*::: Ha that's what Einstein said
U36KK4Z09 says -=*[1480490583.001238]-=*::: :slightly_smiling_face: Yes, but relativity has its own problems.
U36KK4Z09 says -=*[1480490617.001239]-=*::: Anyway, I wouldn't worry about breaking encryption that way
U36KK4Z09 says -=*[1480490641.001240]-=*::: the only way would be if a mathematician discovers some formula
U36KK4Z09 says -=*[1480490698.001241]-=*::: I read you response to my forum post, and the other post. Thanks, I'm still processing it...
U099X8H27 says -=*[1480509084.001242]-=*::: Indeed, GPU cracking is a much more realistic concern for crypto atm
U099X8H27 says -=*[1480509156.001243]-=*::: <@U074Q9Q3D> thanks for posting :smile: let me know what you think. I'm not tooo happy with how it turned out.. still figuring out how to get thoughts down onto paper but I didn't want to sit on it forever
U099X8H27 says -=*[1480509165.001244]-=*::: I posted one about proof of stake as well.

U36KK4Z09 says -=*[1480908063.000016]-=*::: <https://eprint.iacr.org/2007/399.pdf> -- a 2007 article describing behaviour of people when part of a security protocol.  It defines a formal way to discuss peolpe, called "ceremony". I wonder would would be a ceremony model for Blockstack, registering an id for someone named Bob.

U36KK4Z09 says -=*[1480953913.000025]-=*::: In his "ceremony" paper he makes this definition of a meaningful ID: "A _meaningful ID_ for use by some human being is an identifier that calls to that human users mind the correct identified entity"
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1480954313.000026]-=*::: <@U36KK4Z09> yeah the way we look at it is users should be able to authenticate into applications anonymously and authenticate with as much information as they'd like
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1480954333.000027]-=*::: if they present information, by default they will use an app-specific ID (not known by other applications)
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1480954360.000028]-=*::: and if they want to bring certain verified identity and reputation components, they can present their globally unique username
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1480954445.000029]-=*::: Example that fits the last one: you have a public account with twitter and want to sign up for a decentralized twitter and bring your tweet history with proof
