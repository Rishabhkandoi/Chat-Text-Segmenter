U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1478017468.001212]-=*::: <@U2FFR8MA4> make sure that your spec has `imagePullPolicy:IfNotPresent`
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1478017482.001213]-=*::: that will tell k8s to use the local version if its already built
==========
U1VL8H66Q says -=*[1478021973.001214]-=*::: I noticed that v0.12.1 changelog includes "Run kube-dns as addon instead of vendored in kube2sky". Just curious if that is expected to change DNS behavior at all. Just wondering because I've had some strange DNS issues I haven't had a chance to gather enough info to make a ticket on, and wondering if there's a chance it could have been fixed already.
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1478021993.001215]-=*::: <@U1VL8H66Q> there shouldn't be any difference
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1478022013.001217]-=*::: what kind of DNS issues are you having?
U1VL8H66Q says -=*[1478022084.001218]-=*::: I don't have all the info we gathered on it in front of me right now, but for some of our developers, they are unable to resolve internet names when using ClusterFirst dnsPolicy. Was unable to figure out what was different that it was working for some people and not others
U1VL8H66Q says -=*[1478022102.001219]-=*::: (This is as of v0.10.0)
U1VL8H66Q says -=*[1478022203.001220]-=*::: <@U1VL8H66Q|blab> uploaded a file: <https://kubernetes.slack.com/files/blab/F2X0Q92R1/-.txt|Untitled>
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1478022264.001221]-=*::: maybe its related to this issue? <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/17406>
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1478022274.001223]-=*::: running DNS as a pod might have broken this
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1478022288.001224]-=*::: the kube-dns has hostNetwork: true
U1VL8H66Q says -=*[1478022305.001225]-=*::: As an example of the behavior that was seen. The workaround I did for now was to overwrite the VMs resolv.conf to have the kubernetes DNS and the 10.0.2.1 or whatever the VBox DNS is as servers and have dnsPolicy: Default on everything
U1VL8H66Q says -=*[1478022312.001226]-=*::: Oh let me take a look
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1478022318.001227]-=*::: im not sure if that issue is valid
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1478022321.001228]-=*::: its a year old
U0C6963R6 says -=*[1478022358.001229]-=*::: one problem I've noticed is that if I'm running dnsmasq along with minikube things go sideways
U0C6963R6 says -=*[1478022369.001230]-=*::: I haven't had a chance to work it out, so I just dropped dnsmasq for now
U0C6963R6 says -=*[1478022377.001231]-=*::: back to using simple /etc/hosts
U0C6963R6 says -=*[1478022422.001232]-=*::: might not be related to your issue above
U1VL8H66Q says -=*[1478022523.001233]-=*::: Not related since I am not using dnsmasq, but we have plans to use dnsmasq in the future, so I am still glad you said it!
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1478022589.001234]-=*::: theres this issue ive just commented on <https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/781>
U1VL8H66Q says -=*[1478022642.001236]-=*::: Yeah, finding that issue is what led to me looking at the changelog and seeing that. We're still on 0.10.0 so it's probably not the same issue as us I think
U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1478022649.001237]-=*::: gotcha
U1VL8H66Q says -=*[1478022737.001238]-=*::: I think the issue #17406 is probably also not related because it works for some people and not others with seemingly the same setup. I guess at some point I am just going to have to try to gather as much info as I can and make a ticket

U1TUWPL1M says -=*[1478023268.001240]-=*::: thats odd - maybe your machine is in weird state.  try a `minikube start `?
==========
U0B9MPWSE says -=*[1478024097.001241]-=*::: not sure if this is a kube or minikube issue, but are hostpath volumes supposed to work with deployments?  On a minikube instance a pod can mount a hostpath just fine, but the same pod deployed via a deployment ends up with what appears to be an emptydir instead.

U20L8GGUF says -=*[1478032661.001243]-=*::: What is the best way to verify a worker node can access the api-master?
U20L8GGUF says -=*[1478034317.001244]-=*::: ^^ if the port is open this is the easiest way:   ```curl http://$master-ip:8080/api```
