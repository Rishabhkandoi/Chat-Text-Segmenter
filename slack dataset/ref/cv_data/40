U074Q9Q3D says -=*[1473346620.000037]-=*::: Not sure I buy his phases argument either.  The analogy to the Web falls apart when you consider that even though most people don't know/care about TCP/IP, it's more than capable of serving billions of people (and has existed for far longer than the Web).  Even if every single bitcoin block since genesis had 1000 transactions, and each transaction gave a unique address money, you'd still be on-boarding only 430 million people.  If the goal is to bring cryptocurrencies to 1 billion people, all the underlying infrastructure needs to be able to support it first.

U074Q9Q3D says -=*[1473347084.000049]-=*::: sorry, let me rephrase--I'm cautioning the reader that making the system more accessible doesn't automatically bring more users.  If the Internet only supported ~1 millions users, it wouldn't matter how user-friendly and programmer-friendly you made the web browser; you'd still be capped at 1 million users.

U0DAU9JT1 says -=*[1473376553.000078]-=*::: And the c-word needs a name too, perhaps app is it, but I would like to find a word that connotes peer and equal participant. Oh just realized that app+peer+engine will be controlled by person.
U0DAU9JT1 says -=*[1473376964.000080]-=*::: And at first I thought the triplet if app+peer+engine would always be a single always run together thing, but realize now that there is likely a client-server like scenario for mobile use case.  That is if we're not onto a next Moore's law exponential growth of # of cores per processor, or some other analogous growth paradigm (e.g  iot   widgets everywhere)
