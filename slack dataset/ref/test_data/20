U074Q9Q3D says -=*[1473971563.000254]-=*::: Salient quote from the economist:  <http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21707210-rise-corporate-colossus-threatens-both-competition-and-legitimacy-business> ``` Prudent policymakers must reinvent antitrust for the digital age...It means making it easier for consumers to move their data from one company to another, and preventing tech firms from unfairly privileging their own services on platforms they control (an area where the commission, in its pursuit of Google, deserves credit). And it means making sure that people have a choice of ways of authenticating their identity online. ```
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1473971811.000256]-=*::: <@U074Q9Q3D> whoa great find!
U0DAU9JT1 says -=*[1473998599.000258]-=*::: Re anti-trust, I am of the Ayn Rand school: National Anti-Trust laws are pushed by large corporations because they are adept at compliance, with resources focused just on that.  Innovators are the ones who pay the price by becoming bogged down and held back by regulation and compliance costs.
U0DAU9JT1 says -=*[1473998646.000259]-=*::: Further, enabling people to move from one centralized service to another is not a solution.
U0DAU9JT1 says -=*[1473998770.000260]-=*::: Enabling self-hosted distributed and human-friendly is the solution.  Further, the paradigm change is for personal information shared with a company to be specifically crafted for a limited and specific business transaction - outside of which the information is unauthorized and would be great if one could have an automatic key revocation that could be set to match the tx.
U0DAU9JT1 says -=*[1473998819.000261]-=*::: Where law will help us is to somehow deem it illegal to use data without cryptographic proof of permission to use the data.
U0DAU9JT1 says -=*[1473998942.000262]-=*::: Lastly, I believe that distributed systems will level the playing field in business transactions - no longer with the size (e.g. # of employees/people/resources) of a company determine who sets the rules - for example no longer will we all just click "ok" accept the unreasonable terms of vendors who have legal muscle to continue to sell with a take or leave it in-elastic market advantage.

U076J2XV5 says -=*[1474008492.000265]-=*::: James that sounds very similar to VRM, are you familiar? <https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Main_Page>
U0DAU9JT1 says -=*[1474031432.000266]-=*::: <@U076J2XV5> Yes, I read the intention economy by @dsearls (Doc Searls) - and read into this also.
U0DAU9JT1 says -=*[1474031539.000267]-=*::: It is very similar, and I think it is feasible as perhaps a layer on top of a firm distributed foundation - e.g. distributed identity and payments - perhaps even openbazaar is enough of a shift that VRM would not be necessary, but could be a useful user-friendly layer on top.

U25JPMENL says -=*[1475896987.000698]-=*::: <@U08BDV693>: This report is a classic. It focuses on what is today and not what could be. In addition, it does not focus on how the technology can improve people's lives but rather how it could solve plumbing problems. It is indicative of a lack of real knowledge of medical use case problems that could be solved with the technilogy in the future. You must conceptually cross the chasm.  I saw these types of reports when I started one first digital payment companies back in the late nineties when I competed with PayPal and sold to Digital River.  I suggest a top down approach in healthcare rather than bottoms ups.  I wish you and your firm all the best.  Cyrus.
