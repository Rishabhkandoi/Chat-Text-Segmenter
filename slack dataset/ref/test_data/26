U2HR3B24A says -=*[1481911914.000493]-=*::: Im pretty windows ignorant these days, if a mixed cluster of windows/linux hosts in the same cluster ( a feature thats already a thing? ) .. whats the solution if the linux hosts are using flannel?
U0JFJ4KHS says -=*[1481913837.000494]-=*::: <@U2HR3B24A>, yes windows/linux hosts in the same cluster is possible. k8s 1.5 release added windows support as an alpha feature
U0JFJ4KHS says -=*[1481913862.000495]-=*::: For now, the k8s control plane needs to be on linux
U2HR3B24A says -=*[1481913877.000496]-=*::: yeah i knew windows w/1.5 i was 99% sure mixed clusters
U2HR3B24A says -=*[1481913902.000497]-=*::: hmm have to label up some nodes, (were about a day away from self-hosted)
U0JFJ4KHS says -=*[1481913932.000498]-=*::: we have tested with linux hosts using kubenet, haven't tested it with flannel yet
U2HR3B24A says -=*[1481914011.000500]-=*::: yeah were using the 25.0.0.0/8 on the overlay network, Im just wondering how I get the windows boxes to participate
U0JFJ4KHS says -=*[1481914173.000501]-=*::: when you create the transparent network on windows nodes, can you provide the subnet from the above network
U2HR3B24A says -=*[1481915753.000502]-=*::: yeah its not clear to me how that would work at all
U2HR3B24A says -=*[1481915949.000503]-=*::: but my networking fu is also not strong, i came to kube through dev, not through ops
U0JFJ4KHS says -=*[1481916149.000504]-=*::: same with me :slightly_smiling_face:
U0JFJ4KHS says -=*[1481916167.000505]-=*::: what subnet it assigns to linux nodes
U0JFJ4KHS says -=*[1481916380.000506]-=*::: I might be wrong here..if 1st linux node gets assigned 25.0.1.0/24, you could use for example 25.0.2.0/24 when creating transparent network on Windows..Also, 25.0.0.0/8 doesn't appear to be a private subnet range
U0JFJ4KHS says -=*[1481916465.000507]-=*::: May be <@U0ALRFJH0>  have more insights on this
U2HR3B24A says -=*[1481916796.000509]-=*::: each node gets a class b...
U2HR3B24A says -=*[1481916815.000510]-=*::: so 25.1.0.0 25.2.0.0 to assign to pods
U2HR3B24A says -=*[1481916819.000511]-=*::: currently
U2HR3B24A says -=*[1481916839.000512]-=*::: but flannel does encasulation between the nodes
U2HR3B24A says -=*[1481916865.000513]-=*::: youd have to have a decoder on the windows nodes to decapsule those network packets
U2HR3B24A says -=*[1481916881.000514]-=*::: i think well have to reconsider the whole approach for a hybrid cluster
U0JFJ4KHS says -=*[1481918769.000515]-=*::: true, looks like unless there is a windows agent for flannel, this won't work
U2HR3B24A says -=*[1481919686.000516]-=*::: yeah im not sure coreos is super interested in working on something like that
U2HR3B24A says -=*[1481919725.000517]-=*::: we may have to go to something something something.. bgp?
U0BMY7D2Q says -=*[1481923466.000518]-=*::: Yes, we need to make a sig-azure, but I just haven't had the chance. Maybe next week.

U0BMY7D2Q says -=*[1481923481.000520]-=*::: Anyway <@U2YL40JL8> you can PM me here if you like.
U0BMY7D2Q says -=*[1481923496.000521]-=*::: Or file issues on GitHub, it's really the best way, there will be 8x as many people looking at it.

U2U84B4BE says -=*[1481983382.000525]-=*::: <@U2HR3B24A>  we have been gone thru the similar discussion last week in my team. I think it's better to have separate clusters for Linux and Windows at this moment.
U2U84B4BE says -=*[1481983422.000526]-=*::: Regarding the networking , I believe L3 routing is doable no matter you have a mixed or separated clusters.
U2U84B4BE says -=*[1481983496.000527]-=*::: you could even possible to have a L2 network across Linux/Windows hosts, for Linux you go for macvlan, for Windows you go for transparent net driver.

U2U84B4BE says -=*[1482116464.000531]-=*::: I left a comment in that thread to detail this use case.

U0JFJ4KHS says -=*[1482162546.000541]-=*::: do we update the documentation? I think the solution should be disabling swap by default
U0PPMUTGR says -=*[1482162607.000542]-=*::: whatever you think is best
U2U84B4BE says -=*[1482162755.000543]-=*::: I used a private dirty fix on Kubelet to make it pass-in MemorySwap=0 for Windows.

U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1482248157.000572]-=*::: <@U0JFJ4KHS> correct. why did they do that? just to mimic two nodes in just one?
U0JFJ4KHS says -=*[1482248171.000573]-=*::: I was wondering about that too

U0JFJ4KHS says -=*[1482248656.000578]-=*::: the acs documentation uses `10.240.0.1` as gateway, but I don't think it is the default gateway for all Azure VMs
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1482250141.000579]-=*::: i don't understand why the _forwarder_ subnet exists then.
U0ALRFJH0 says -=*[1482251821.000580]-=*::: <@U0JFJ4KHS> ah, it seems one transparent network is used solely for k8s service routing.
U0JFJ4KHS says -=*[1482251864.000581]-=*::: if that is the case, it won't resolve network access issue
