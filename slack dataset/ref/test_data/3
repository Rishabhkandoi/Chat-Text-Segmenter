U0722SJ4A says -=*[1458851069.000043]-=*::: Hey folks I wrote this new blog post on how NPM could use Blockstack to solve their package security problems.
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1458851092.000044]-=*::: Would love your thoughts on whether this would work and if working with other package managers first might make more sense.
U076LGFE0 says -=*[1458851155.000045]-=*::: it would be great to have a tld for each package manager
U076LGFE0 says -=*[1458851170.000046]-=*::: `.rubygems` etc
U074Q9Q3D says -=*[1458851188.000047]-=*::: `.apt`
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1458851209.000048]-=*::: yeah that would make sense
U076LGFE0 says -=*[1458851231.000049]-=*::: its so $$$$ to start a tld though :wink:
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1458851260.000051]-=*::: yeah ha
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1458851320.000052]-=*::: But we were thinking that we can do this thing where if registers a namespace, you put up the money up front and then you can make back all of the cost through proceeds from the name registrations. Then, after that, once you break even, all the proceeds will go to miners.
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1458851338.000053]-=*::: So its a way to incentivize the creation of namespaces that actually end up getting used.
U076LGFE0 says -=*[1458851346.000054]-=*::: motivation to promote your tld
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1458851360.000055]-=*::: Because if you register the names yourself, youre still paying 100% of the cost.
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1458851363.000056]-=*::: Exactly
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1458851377.000057]-=*::: Youll want to promote it so others register the names and help you make back your investment

U076LGFE0 says -=*[1458907042.000060]-=*::: this was an amazing talk explaining segregated witness and the problems it solves in pretty easy to understand language by co-author of bips 141-143. i made a video of it because so many people wanted to attend the event but couldnt make it.
U0723KV7E says -=*[1458918925.000061]-=*::: Great video <@U076LGFE0>.. A bit long so Ill have to finish it up over the weekend. Are you planning on producing more of these on a regular basis?
