U0722SJ4A says -=*[1462913487.000244]-=*::: ```Until you solve decentralized identity, you cant really build other services off of that. This is the first problem that needs to get addressed. But doing a simulation or a proof of concept is very different from running a production system.```
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1462913502.000245]-=*::: ```During the same panel with Allen, Blockstack Labs co-founder Muneeb Ali explained the technical limitations of building an identity platform on the blockchain, using firsthand experience from the creation of Onename.  Ali added that developers shouldnt think of blockchain as a one-size-fits-all solution, but rather one that should only be applied thoughtfully as part of a larger plan. He warned that not all blockchains provide equal identity control and should be selected carefully.```

U09BK9SMD says -=*[1463374847.000294]-=*::: Its a book by Neal Stephenson (also wrote cryptonomicon). The fuzzy screen/snow on that GIF reminded me of it. Just being silly :simple_smile:
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1463375029.000295]-=*::: Oh right! <@U074Q9Q3D> was telling me about it. I'm reading Cryptonomicon now.
U09BK9SMD says -=*[1463375243.000296]-=*::: Nice! Yeah, its a good one. I hope the new meetup and everything is going well.

U0722SJ4A says -=*[1464122672.000345]-=*::: Nice post <@U0BTC3MM1>! <https://medium.com/the-coinbase-blog/ethereum-is-the-forefront-of-digital-currency-5300298f6c75#.e59tmk91l>
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1464123198.000348]-=*::: Thinking back to our conversation when I presented a view that aligns with this quote: ```There is a decent argument (best articulated by Gavin Andresen in his article Bit-thereum) that its better to keep the base transaction layer dumb for scaling reasons with advanced logic in higher layers. Its possible we come full circle and end up back there, but this isnt how interesting things are being created at the moment because its harder to 1) create and 2) get decent adoption of multiple layers in the stack than it is to have it all out of the box in Ethereum.```
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1464123366.000349]-=*::: Ethereum is the platform to build decentralized apps directly on the chain. Blockstack is the platform to build decentralized apps on a layer above the chain.
U074Q9Q3D says -=*[1464123380.000350]-=*::: and with Blockstack, your apps aren't tied to the fate of the blockchain
U074Q9Q3D says -=*[1464123397.000351]-=*::: heck, apps don't even need to be aware of the fact that the blockchain exists
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1464123401.000352]-=*::: chain mobility
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1464123410.000353]-=*::: also, you can build apps across chains
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1464123419.000354]-=*::: utilizing TLDs and directories on multiple chains
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1464123448.000356]-=*::: Our challenge and focus is to make our platform easier to use and our documentation easy to follow
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1464123468.000358]-=*::: With some great articles, videos and tutorials
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1464123481.000359]-=*::: And were making lots of great progress there
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1464123539.000360]-=*::: Pretty sure with our next wave of documentation and our next release of the blockstack server and CLI, developers will be blown away by the experience of building apps on blockstack
U0722SJ4A says -=*[1464123841.000361]-=*::: Nice article by <@U08UB2ENM> - Blockstack is mentioned! <https://medium.com/@delitzer/a-framework-for-identity-f7f072829cbb#.4g013yrs3>
